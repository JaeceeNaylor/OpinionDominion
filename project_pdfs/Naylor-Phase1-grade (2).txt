TEAM NAME: Opinion Dominion
TEAM MEMBERS: Jaecee Naylor
TASK: SemEval 2016 Sentiment-Aspect Extraction from Restaurant Reviews

System Design: A
Evaluation: A-
Demonstration: A
Report: A
---------------
OVERALL: A (95)


Strengths:

* Looks like you got a lot of the infrastructure set up for this task
  and created a baseline system. 

* The report is well-written and contains a good amount of detail. 

Weaknesses: 

* The report seems confused about the task at hand, for example the
  task description is not consistent with the terminology in the
  results section. For example, you are not just extracting the
  opinion target (OTE), but also extracting the attributes/aspects. And each
  polarity value should be associated with a specific aspect. This is
  what I expected that you'd be doing and I think is what you are
  doing based on the evaluation results, but the discussions in the
  report are not consistent with that. 

* There is no discussion of how the data set was used for
  evaluation. Also results are only reported for the trial data and
  training data, but these results are not very meaningful because you
  presumably used them for development. The only truly meaningful
  results would be based on unseen test cases. 

Feedback: 

* For Phase 2, I will expect a system design that involves substantial
  new components, ideally some sort of statistical or machine learning
  model (at least for some part of this task). 

* Please take some time to be sure that you completely understand all
  the components of the task and the terminology for each part of the
  task. For example, see:
  https://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task5/data/uploads/absa2016_annotationguidelines.pdf
  Your Phase 2 report should  describe the task and what your system does more
  precisely. 

* For Phase 2, please make sure that you present evaluation results
  for a blind test set (or using cross-validation).

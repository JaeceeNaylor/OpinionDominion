---------------
OVERALL: A+ (100)  Excellent Work!


Feedback: 

* excellent progress in Phase 2! Several new machine learning
  components, including a CRF classifier to extract targets. 

* good demo

* both cross-validation and separate training/test splits is great!
  Plus a third pseudo-test experiment ... you can probably skip that
  one going forward. 

* How many polarity values are there? If there are 3
  (pos/neg/neutral), then the results could make sense. But if there
  are only 2 (pos/neg), then your polarity results are close to 50/50
  which means that the classifier isn't learning much (assuming a
  roughly even split in the training data). And even if there are 3
  classes, I'd expect to see better performance. So there might be a
  bug somewhere or issue with the ways it's being trained, etc -- I'd
  suggest investigating that model. 

* How many different aspect categories are there? It would be nice to
  see recall & precision scores for each of the classes. 

* For Phase 3, I'd focus most of your effort on the Opinion Target
  Extraction model, since that's the main IE component. It would be
  nice to see an exact match score as well, and some analysis of
  whether (say) there is often good overlap but not an exact match for
  some common reasons (e.g., adjective often missed, or something like
  that).
